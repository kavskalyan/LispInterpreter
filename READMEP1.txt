Steps to compile and run:
1. The program uses c++ 11. So if using from stdlinux, the package GCC-4.9.1 needs to be subscribed using ‘subscribe’ command.
2. To run the Makefile to compile the program, the command “make” should to be entered.
3. To execute the program, the command ‘./part1’ should be entered.

Assumptions on input:
1. Tab will not be considered as space. It will just be skipped.
2. Characters other than tabspace, carriage return, blank space, Alphabet, numbers, +, -,(,) should not be entered. 
3. A dollar symbol, even if is not in a new line, and if it is at the end of an s-expression will be considered as end of the expression. 
Ideally $ should be used only to separate s-expressions.
4. Two dollars even with white space separating them will end the input.
